# systembolagetApkExtention

## description
It replaces the "kr/l" with the APK (ml ethanol per kr) of the selected product on systembolaget.se. Drink smarter, and cheaper.

## known bugs
~~when first clicking on a product the APK is displayed properly, however if the page is refreshed it simply shows as "undefined". This may be an issue in when the script is run... honestly idfk. This error does not occur when the inspect menu is open. Which makes this hell to debug.~~ Should be fixed.



~~abv is cast to an integer... ffs...~~ NOT YET COMPILED!



some seemingly random numbers are sometimes added to the start of some APKs. This happens for example with [Weinwurm](https://www.systembolaget.se/produkt/vin/weinwurm-2315301/). Please submit any additional faulty product pages [here](https://forms.gle/f6RsMeme7gchasgv7).
