# systembolagetApkExtention

## known bugs
when first clicking on a product the APK is displayed properly, however if the page is refreshed it simply shows as "undefined". This may be an issue in when the script is run... honestly idfk. This error does not occur when the inspect menu is open. Which makes this hell to debug.
